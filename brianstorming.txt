The Second Hand
Sometime people do not have enough money to buy new things or some people prefer second hand things because they are cheap.
Although there are many apps for this purpose but I also wanted to create one with some extra features that I think they 
are not there in the apps.

Advantages of used products:

Used products are less expensive.
Used products don't require new resources.
Used products don't generate pollution.
Used products don't require energy to create.
Used products don't have packaging.
Buying used supports good causes and the local economy.

What does my app does?

It has a parallel system for customers running side by side. 
People who wish to sell any goods can upload their advertisements just like one is expected to do in a classifieds portal.
 People who wish to buy goods may browse through the listing
 If the user likes the product he can call the provider or chat with him with a chat feature in my app.
